However, large sets can cause a phenomenon called \u201cchoice overload\u201d: they are more difficult to choose from, and as a result decision makers are less satisfied with their choices. It has been argued that choice overload occurs because large sets contain more similar items. To overcome this effect, the present paper proposes that increasing the diversity of item sets might make them more attractive and satisfactory, without making them much more difficult to choose from. To this purpose, by using structural equation model methodology, we study diversification based on the latent features of a matrix factorization recommender model. Study 1 diversifies a set of recommended items while controlling for the overall quality of the set, and tests it in two online user experiments with a movie recommender system. Study 1a tests the effectiveness of the latent feature diversification, and shows that diversification increases the perceived diversity and attractiveness of the item set, while at the same time reducing the perceived difficulty of choosing from the set. Study 1b subsequently shows that diversification can increase users\u2019 satisfaction with the chosen option, especially when they are choosing from small, diverse item sets. Study 2 extends these results by testing our diversification algorithm against traditional Top-N recommendations, and finds that diverse, small item sets are just as satisfying and less effortful to choose from than Top-N recommendations. Our results suggest that, at least for the movie domain, diverse small sets may be the best thing one could offer a user of a recommender system."], "url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11257-016-9178-6"},

In this paper, we address the problem of privacy preserving matrix factorization by utilizing differential privacy, a rigorous and provable approach to privacy in statistical databases. We propose a generic framework and evaluate several ways, in which differential privacy can be applied to matrix factorization. By doing so, we specifically address the privacy-accuracy trade-off offered by each of the algorithms. We show that, of all the algorithms considered, input perturbation results in the best recommendation accuracy, while guaranteeing a solid level of privacy protection against attacks that aim to gain knowledge about either specific user ratings or even the existence of these ratings.

This paper introduces an innovative e-health framework that develops adaptive serious games for people with hand disabilities. The aim of this work is to provide a patient-adaptive environment for the gamification of hand therapies in order to facilitate and encourage rehabilitation issues. Theoretical foundations (i.e., therapy and patient models) and algorithms to match therapy-based hand gestures to navigational movements in 3D space within the serious game environment have been developed. A novel game generation module is introduced, which translates those movements into a 3D therapy-driven route on a real-world map and with different levels of difficulty based on the patient profile and capabilities. In order to enrich the user navigation experience, a 3D spatio-temporal validation region is also generated, which tracks and adjusts the patient movements throughout the session. The gaming environment also creates and adds semantics to different types of attractive and repellent objects in space depending on the difficulty level of the game. Relevant benchmarks to assess the patient interaction with the environment along with a usability and performance testing of our framework are introduced to ensure quantitative as well as qualitative improvements.

They use data sets of contextually-tagged ratings to predict how the target user would evaluate (rate) an item in a given contextual situation, with the ultimate goal to recommend the items with the best estimated ratings. This paper describes and evaluates a pre-filtering approach to context-aware recommendation, called distributional-semantics pre-filtering (DSPF), which exploits in a novel way the distributional semantics of contextual conditions to build more precise context-aware rating prediction models. In DSPF, given a target contextual situation (of a target user), a matrix-factorization predictive model is built by using the ratings tagged with the contextual situations most similar to the target one. Then, this model is used to compute rating predictions and identify recommendations for that specific target contextual situation. In the proposed approach, the definition of the similarity of contextual situations is based on the distributional semantics of their composing conditions: situations are similar if they influence the user\u2019s ratings in a similar way. This notion of similarity has the advantage of being directly derived from the rating data; hence it does not require a context taxonomy. We analyze the effectiveness of DSPF varying the specific method used to compute the situation-to-situation similarity. We also show how DSPF can be further improved by using clustering techniques.

The experiments show that there are large discrepancies in the effectiveness of identical recommendation approaches in only slightly different scenarios, as well as large discrepancies for slightly different approaches in identical scenarios. For example, in one news-recommendation scenario, the performance of a content-based filtering approach was twice as high as the second-best approach, while in another scenario the same content-based filtering approach was the worst performing approach. We found several determinants that may contribute to the large discrepancies observed in recommendation effectiveness.

CF assumes that the users\u2019 recorded ratings can help in predicting their future ratings. This has been validated extensively, but in some domains the user\u2019s ratings can be influenced by contextual conditions, such as the time, or the goal of the item consumption. This type of contextual information is not exploited by standard CF models. This paper introduces and analyzes a novel technique for context-aware CF called Item Splitting. In this approach items experienced in two alternative contextual conditions are \u201csplit\u201d into two items. This means that the ratings of a split item, e.g., a place to visit, are assigned (split) to two new fictitious items representing for instance the place in summer and the same place in winter. This split is performed only if there is statistical evidence that under these two contextual conditions the items ratings are different; for instance, a place may be rated higher in summer than in winter. These two new fictitious items are then used, together with the unaffected items, in the rating prediction algorithm. When the system must predict the rating for that \u201csplit\u201d item in a particular contextual condition (e.g., in summer), it will consider the new fictitious item representing the original one in that particular contextual condition, and will predict its rating. We evaluated this approach on real world, and semi-synthetic data sets using matrix factorization, and nearest neighbor CF algorithms. We show that Item Splitting can be beneficial and its performance depends on the method used to determine which items to split. We also show that the benefit of the method is determined by the relevance of the contextual factors that are used to split."], "url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11257-012-9137-9"},

Hybreed is based on a concept for processing context that we call dynamic contextualization. The underlying notion of context is very generic, enabling application developers to exploit sensor-based physical factors as well as factors derived from user models or user interaction. This approach is well aligned with context definitions that emphasize the dynamic and activity-oriented nature of context. As an extension of the generic framework, we describe Hybreed RecViews, a set of components facilitating the development of context-aware and hybrid recommender systems. With Hybreed and RecViews, developers can rapidly develop context-aware applications that generate recommendations for both individual users and groups. The framework provides a range of recommendation algorithms and strategies for producing group recommendations as well as templates for combining different methods into hybrid recommenders. Hybreed also provides means for integrating existing user or product data from external sources such as social networks. It combines aspects known from context processing frameworks with features of state-of-the-art recommender system frameworks, aspects that have been addressed only separately in previous research. To our knowledge, Hybreed is the first framework to cover all these aspects in an integrated manner. To evaluate the framework and its conceptual foundation, we verified its capabilities in three different use cases.

First, there may be a mismatch between the quantitative preference representations in most preference models and the users\u2019 mental preference models. Giving exact numbers, e.g., such as \u201cI like 30\u00a0days of vacation 2.5\u00a0times better than 28\u00a0days\u201d is difficult for people. Second, the elicitation process can greatly influence the acquired model (e.g., people may prefer different options based on whether a choice is represented as a loss or gain). We explored these issues in three studies. In the first experiment we presented users with different preference elicitation methods and found that cognitively less demanding methods were perceived low in effort and high in liking. However, for methods enabling users to be more expressive, the perceived effort was not an indicator of how much the methods were liked. We thus hypothesized that users are willing to spend more effort if the feedback mechanism enables them to be more expressive. We examined this hypothesis in two follow-up studies. In the second experiment, we explored the trade-off between giving detailed preference feedback and effort. We found that familiarity with and opinion about an item are important factors mediating this trade-off. Additionally, affective feedback was preferred over a finer grained one-dimensional rating scale for giving additional detail. In the third study, we explored the influence of the interface on the elicitation process in a participatory set-up. People considered it helpful to be able to explore the link between their interests, preferences and the desirability of outcomes. We also confirmed that people do not want to spend additional effort in cases where it seemed unnecessary. Based on the findings, we propose four design guidelines to foster interface design of preference elicitation from a user view."], "url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11257-011-9116-6"},

Traces of interaction represent the users\u2019 activities with an interactive environment.

However, cultural heritage sites have a huge amount of information to present, which must be filtered and personalized in order to enable the individual user to easily access it. Personalization of cultural heritage information requires a system that is able to model the user (e.g., interest, knowledge and other personal characteristics), as well as contextual aspects, select the most appropriate content, and deliver it in the most suitable way. It should be noted that achieving this result is extremely challenging in the case of first-time users, such as tourists who visit a cultural heritage site for the first time (and maybe the only time in their life). In addition, as tourism is a social activity, adapting to the individual is not enough because groups and communities have to be modeled and supported as well, taking into account their mutual interests, previous mutual experience, and requirements. How to model and represent the user(s) and the context of the visit and how to reason with regard to the information that is available are the challenges faced by researchers in personalization of cultural heritage. Notwithstanding the effort invested so far, a definite solution is far from being reached, mainly because new technology and new aspects of personalization are constantly being introduced.

Social Computing Applications (SCA) allow users to discuss various topics in online forums, share their thoughts in blogs, share photos, videos, bookmarks, and connect with friends through social networks. Yet, the design of successful social applications that attract and sustain active contribution by their users still remains more of an art than a science. My research over the last 10\u00a0years has been based on the hypothesis that it is possible to incorporate mechanisms and tools in the design of the social application that can motivate users to participate, and more generally, to change their behavior in a desirable way, which is beneficial for the community. Since different people are motivated by different things, it can be expected that personalizing the incentives and the way the rewards are presented to the individual, would be beneficial. Also since communities have different needs in different phases of their existence, it is necessary to model the changing needs of communities and adapt the incentive mechanisms accordingly, to attract the kind of contributions that are beneficial. Therefore User and Group (Community) Modeling is an important area in the design of incentive mechanisms. This paper presents an overview of different approaches to motivate users to participate.

We then present a multimodal corpus consisting of the annotated facial expressions used by a speaker to accompany the generated tailored descriptions, and verify that the most characteristic positive and negative expressions used by that speaker are identifiable when resynthesised on an artificial talking head. Finally, we combine the corpus-derived facial displays with the tailored descriptions to test whether the addition of the non-verbal channel improves users\u2019 ability to detect the intended tailoring, comparing two strategies for selecting the displays: one based on a simple corpus-derived rule, and one making direct use of the full corpus data.

The diversity of these solutions and their lack of common characteristics are an indication of how unresolved this issue remains. Bearing this in mind, our research has made progress on several fronts. First, we have found supportive evidence, based on a collaborative learning experience with hundreds of students over three consecutive years, that an approach using domain independent learning that is transferable to current e-learning platforms helps both students and teachers to manage student collaboration better. Second, the approach draws on a domain-independent modeling method of collaborative learning based on data mining that helps clarify which user-modeling issues are to be considered.

Since the users may have diverse backgrounds and may have different expectations for a given query, some search engines try to personalize their results to better match the overall interests of an individual user.

Second, once such a profile is available, the search engines need to rank the results in a way that matches the interests of a given user. In this article, we present our work towards a personalized Web search engine and we discuss how we addressed each of these challenges. Since users are typically not willing to provide information on their personal preferences, for the first challenge, we attempt to determine such preferences by examining the click history of each user. In particular, we leverage a topical ontology for estimating a user\u2019s topic preferences based on her past searches, i.e. previously issued queries and pages visited for those queries. We then explore the semantic similarity between the user\u2019s current query and the query-matching pages, in order to identify the user\u2019s current topic preference.

It has led to the dissemination of systems capable of suggesting relevant and personalized information (or items) to the users, according to their characteristics and preferences, as represented by a User Model (UM). Since the quality of the personalization largely depends on the size and accuracy of the managed UMs, it would be beneficial to enrich the UMs by mediating, i.e., importing and integrating, UMs built by other personalization systems. This work discusses and evaluates a cross-representation mediation of UMs from collaborative filtering to content-based recommender systems. According to this approach, a content-based recommender system, having partial or no UM data, can generate recommendations for users by mediating UM data of the same users, collected by a collaborative filtering system. The mediation process transforms the UMs from the collaborative filtering ratings to the content-based weighted item features. The mediation process exploits the item descriptions that are typically not used by the collaborative filtering recommender systems. An experimental evaluation conducted in the domain of movies shows that for users with small collaborative filtering UMs, i.e., users with few item ratings, the accuracy of the recommendations provided using the mediated content-based UMs is superior to that using the original collaborative filtering UMs. Moreover, it shows that the mediation can be used to improve a content-based recommender system by incrementally mediating collaborative filtering UM data (item ratings) and enriching the available content-based UMs."], "url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11257-008-9055-z"},

One aspect of motivation is engagement, a necessary condition for effective learning. Using data mining techniques for log file analysis, our research investigates the possibility of predicting users\u2019 level of engagement, with a focus on disengaged learners.

The webform development process must therefore, include modeling of its intended users to ensure the interface design is appropriate. Taking all potential users into account is difficult, however, primarily because their identity is unknown, and some may be effectively excluded by the final design. Such discrimination can be avoided by incorporating rules that allow webforms to adapt automatically to the individual user\u2019s characteristics, the principal one being the person\u2019s culture. In this paper we report two studies that validate this option. We begin by determining the relationships between a user\u2019s cultural dimension scores and their behavior when faced with a webform.

Finally, we consider a computational mechanism to explain the results. This approach is aimed at understanding how a feedback mechanism might work rather than at observing its outcomes. In this paper, we study the approach through adjustments in card selections in a game consisting of repeated card choices. Playing this game, participants do not know what rules determine gains and losses. Therefore there is some tension between exploring the options and achieving immediate profit. To decide in such situations it is argued that often evaluations below the level of conscious awareness, such as affect, play an important role. The results support the hypothesis that participants would draw better cards as the game progressed. There is some evidence that emotions are involved, since the hypothesis that profit and emotions are correlated is confirmed. Further evidence that formal logic is not sufficient follows from the observed effects of music on card selections. In the second part of the paper the aim is to understand the results from a computational point of view. Four possible ways of integrating feedback into a decision criterion are compared. Using one of these mechanisms, a computational model is investigated that might describe the role of music in card selection.

Therefore, it is important to provide incentives to encourage participation, until the community reaches a critical mass and \u201ctakes off\u201d. However, too much participation, especially of low-quality can also be detrimental for the community, since it leads to information overload, which makes users leave the community. Therefore, to regulate the quality and the quantity of user contributions and ensure a sustainable level of user participation in the online community, it is important to adapt the rewards for particular forms of participation for individual users depending on their reputation and the current needs of the community. An incentive mechanism with these properties is proposed. The main idea is to measure and reward the desirable user activities and compute a user participation measure, then cluster the users based on their participation measure into different classes, which have different status in the community and enjoy special privileges. For each user, the reward for each type of activity is computed dynamically based on a model of community needs and an individual user model. The model of the community needs predicts what types of contributions (e.g. more new papers or more ratings) are most valuable at the current moment for the community. The individual model predicts the style of contributions of the user based on her past performance (whether the user tends to make high-quality contributions or not, whether she fairly rates the contributions of others). The adaptive rewards are displayed to the user at the beginning of each session and the user can decide what form of contribution to make considering the rewards that she will earn.

Depending upon the task, generic communication tools like chat or a shared whiteboard may not be sufficient to support effective coordination. We have previously reported on a methodology that helps the designer develop task specific communication tools, called coordinating representations, for groupware systems. Coordinating representations lend structure and persistence to coordinating information. We have shown that coordinating representations are readily adopted by a user population, reduce coordination errors, and improve performance in a domain task. As we show in this article, coordinating representations present a unique opportunity to acquire user information in collaborative, user-adapted systems. Because coordinating representations support the exchange of coordinating information, they offer a window onto task and coordination-specific knowledge that is shared by users. Because they add structure to communication, the information that passes through them can be easily exploited by adaptive technology. This approach provides a simple technique for acquiring user knowledge in collaborative, user-adapted systems. We document our application of this approach to an existing groupware system. Several empirical results are provided. First, we show how information that is made available by a coordinating representation can be used to infer user intentions.

User requirements were collected via a survey to understand visitors\u2019 profiles and visit styles in natural science museums. The knowledge acquired supported the specification of system requirements, helping define the user model, data structure and adaptive behaviour of the system.

On the other hand, fast and efficient initialization of the student model is necessary. Otherwise the tutoring system may lose its credibility in the first interactions with the student. In this paper we describe a framework for the initialization of student models in Web-based educational applications. The framework is called ISM. The basic idea of ISM is to set initial values for all aspects of student models using an innovative combination of stereotypes and the distance weighted ", "-nearest neighbor algorithm. In particular, a student is first assigned to a stereotype category concerning her/his knowledge level of the domain being taught. Then, the model of the new student is initialized by applying the distance weighted ", "-nearest neighbor algorithm among the students that belong to the same stereotype category with the new student. ISM has been applied in a language learning system, which has been used as a test-bed. The quality of the student models created using ISM has been evaluated in an experiment involving classroom students and their teachers. The results from this experiment showed that the initialization of student models was improved using the ISM framework."], "url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B%3AUSER.0000043396.14788.cc"},

The personalized Electronic Programme Guide (pEPG) is one solution to this problem; it leverages artificial intelligence and user profiling techniques to learn about the viewing preferences of individual users in order to compile personalized viewing guides that fit their individual preferences. Very often the limited availability of profiling information is a key limiting factor in such personalized recommender systems. For example, it is well known that collaborative filtering approaches suffer significantly from the sparsity problem, which exists because the expected item-overlap between profiles is usually very low. In this article we address the sparsity problem in the Digital TV domain. We propose the use of data mining techniques as a way of supplementing meagre ratings-based profile knowledge with additional item-similarity knowledge that can be automatically discovered by mining user profiles.

Users risk becoming overwhelmed by the flow of information, and they lack adequate tools to help them manage the situation. Information filtering (IF) is one of the methods that is rapidly evolving to manage large information flows. The aim of IF is to expose users to only information that is relevant to them. Many IF systems have been developed in recent years for various application domains. Some examples of filtering applications are: filters for search results on the internet that are employed in the Internet software, personal e-mail filters based on personal profiles, listservers or newsgroups filters for groups or individuals, browser filters that block non-valuable information, filters designed to give children access them only to suitable pages, filters for e-commerce applications that address products and promotions to potential customers only, and many more. The different systems use various methods, concepts, and techniques from diverse research areas like: Information Retrieval, Artificial Intelligence, or Behavioral Science. Various systems cover different scope, have divergent functionality, and various platforms. There are many systems of widely varying philosophies, but all share the goal of automatically directing the most valuable information to users in accordance with their User Model, and of helping them use their limited reading time most optimally. This paper clarifies the difference between IF systems and related systems, such as information retrieval (IR) systems, or Extraction systems. The paper defines a framework to classify IF systems according to several parameters, and illustrates the approach with commercial and academic systems. The paper describes the underlying concepts of IF systems and the techniques that are used to implement them. It discusses methods and measurements that are used for evaluation of IF systems and limitations of the current systems. In the conclusion we present research issues in the Information Filtering research arena, such as user modeling, evaluation standardization and integration with digital libraries and Web repositories."], "url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1011196000674"},

While the first agent provides personalized news through a web-based interface, the second system is geared towards wireless information devices such as PDAs (personal digital assistants) and cell phones. Based on implicit and explicit user feedback, our agents use a machine learning algorithm to induce individual user models. Motivated by general shortcomings of other user modeling systems for Information Retrieval applications, as well as the specific requirements of news classification, we propose the induction of hybrid user models that consist of separate models for short-term and long-term interests.

The goal of the evaluation is not only to understand the performance contributions of the algorithm's individual components, but also to assess the overall utility of the proposed user modeling techniques from a user perspective.

Correspondingly, systems are being built to give the learner greater responsibility and control over all aspects of the learning, and especially over the learner model which is at the core of user-adaptation. A parallel trend is the growing acknowledgement of the importance of the learner's social context. Systems are increasingly being designed for learners working in groups of real or simulated peers.

Finally, the paper highlights some of the research challenges ahead. The normative perspective of the paper is that adaptive techniques in the context of Universal Access have the potential to facilitate both accessibility and high quality interaction, for the broadest possible end-user population. This implies the design of systems that undertake context-sensitive processing so as to manifest their functional core in alternative interactive embodiments suitable for different users, usage patterns and contexts of use. Such a capability needs to be built into the system from the early phases of conception and design, and subsequently validated throughout its life cycle."], "url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1011144232235"},

We need to allow for mixed-initiative retrieval dialogues, where the system evaluates the user's individual dialogue behavior and performs situation-dependent interpretation of user goals, to determine when to take the initiative and to change the control of the dialogue, e.g., to propose (new) problem-solving strategies to the user.

Users are guided through the global stages of the retrieval interaction but may depart, at any time, from this guidance and change the direction of the dialogue.

This article first identifies these needs through a comprehensive overview of logic-based representation and reasoning in user modeling system. Then, the AsTRa (Assumption Type Representation) framework for logic-based user model representation and reasoning is presented. This framework obtains its power and flexibility through an integration of the two main scientific approaches that were pursued to date, namely the partition approach and the modal logic approach. The central notion of the framework is the \u2018assumption type\u2019, a partition-like partial knowledge base for storing all assumptions about the user that are of the same type. Within assumption types, logic-based representation formalisms can be employed. The semantics of assumption types and content formalisms can be characterized in terms of modal logic, so that an extension to full modal logic is possible. Moreover, special mechanisms for handling so-called \u2018negative assumptions\u2019 are developed, which are also firmly grounded in modal logic semantics.

This can result in low prediction accuracy, or otherwise, low prediction rates, leaving a set of cases for which no predictions are made. A previous study that explored techniques for improving prediction rates in the context of modeling students' subtraction skills using Feature Based Modeling showed a tradeoff between prediction rate and predication accuracy. This paper presents research that aims to improve prediction rates without affecting prediction accuracy. The FBM-C4.5 agent modeling system was used in this research. However, the techniques explored are applicable to any Feature Based Modeling system, and the most effective technique developed is applicable to most agent modeling systems. The default FBM-C4.5 system models agents' competencies with a set of decision trees, trained on all historical data. Each tree predicts one particular aspect of the agent's action. Predictions from multiple trees are compared for consensus. FBM-C4.5 makes no prediction when predictions from different trees contradict one another. This strategy trades off reduced prediction rates for increased accuracy. To make predictions in the absence of consensus, three techniques have been evaluated. They include using voting, using a tree quality measure and using a leaf quality measure. An alternative technique that merges multiple decision trees into a single tree provides an advantage of producing models that are more comprehensible. However, all of these techniques demonstrated the previous encountered trade-off between rate of prediction and accuracy of prediction, albeit less pronounced. It was hypothesized that models built on more current observations would outperform models built on earlier observations. Experimental results support this hypothesis. A Dual-model system, which takes this temporal factor into account, has been evaluated.

We then apply simple abstraction and learning techniques in order to speed up the performance of the most promising dynamic belief networks without a significant change in the accuracy of goal predictions. Our experimental results in the application domain show a high degree of predictive accuracy. This indicates that dynamic belief networks in general show promise for predicting a variety of behaviours in domains which have similar features to those of our domain, while reduced models, obtained by means of learning and abstraction, show promise for efficient goal prediction in such domains."], "url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1008238218679"},

These models are improved over time, given feedback on the delivered documents. When selecting documents to recommend, a system faces an instance of the exploration/exploitation tradeoff: whether to deliver documents about which there is little certainty, or those which are known to match the user model learned so far. In this paper, a simulation is constructed to investigate the effects of this tradeoff on the rate of learning user models, and the resulting compositions of the sets of recommended documents, in particular World-Wide Web pages. Document selection strategies are developed which correspond to different points along the tradeoff. Using an exploitative strategy, our results show that simple preference functions can successfully be learned using a vector-space representation of a user model in conjunction with a gradient descent algorithm, but that increasingly complex preference functions lead to a slowing down of the learning process. Exploratory strategies are shown to increase the rate of user model acquisition at the expense of presenting users with suboptimal recommendations; in addition they adapt to user preference changes more rapidly than exploitative strategies. These simulated tests suggest an implementation for a simple control that is exposed to users, allowing them to vary a system's document selection behavior depending on individual circumstances."], "url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1008205606173"},

This model is used to motivate choices in presenting or omitting individual pieces of information; it takes into account the addressees' domain expertise and expectations about logical consequences of purposefully presented information. Several kinds of empirical evidence are incorporated into a text planning process that aims at exploiting conversational implicature, so that a most suitable portion of the plan can be selected for being uttered explicitly. This way, our method adds to discourse planners based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) the ability to omit easily inferable information. Thus, it overcomes one of the main shortcomings of RST. In the course of this process, rules anticipating user inferences are invoked to determine contextually justified derivability of information. In this manner, text variants can be composed on the basis of a text plan entailing annotations about the inferability of pieces of information. Moreover, pragmatically-motivated preference criteria can be used to choose among several plausible variants.

We propose a solution which provides user-centered adaptive information retrieval and navigation. This solution supports users in customizing information access over time.

This functionality allows users to define and access personal collections of information, which are dynamically computed. The system also supports collaborative review by letting users share group access maps. The adaptive relevance network provides long-term adaptation based both on usage and on explicit user input.

The premise is that a single, principled approach to student modeling, involving both theoretical and empirical methods, can render automated instruction more efficacious across a broad array of instructional domains. After defining key terms and discussing limitations to previous student modeling paradigms, I describe the SMART approach, as embedded within a statistics tutor called Stat Lady (Shute and Gluck, 1994). SMART works in conjunction with a tutor design where low-level knowledge and skills (i.e., curricular elements) are identified and separated into three main outcome types. Throughout the tutor, curricular elements with values below a pre-set mastery criterion are instructed, evaluated, and remediated, if necessary. The diagnostic part of the student model is driven by a series of regression equations based on the level of assistance the computer gives each person, per curriculum element. Remediation on a given element occurs when a subject fails to achieve mastery during assessment, which follows instruction. Remediation is precise because each element knows its location within the tutor where it is instructed and assessed. I end with a summary of results from two controlled evaluations of SMART examining the following research issues: (a) diagnostic validity, (b) individual differences in learning from Stat Lady, (c) affective perceptions of the tutorial experience, and (d) contributions of mastery and remediation to learning outcome and efficiency.

The body is the representation of the body of knowledge that a class of users is expected to know, along with the probability that the knowledge is known. In the inference component, the learning process of concepts is represented as a belief network. Hence, in the second step the belief network is used to refine the initial default information in the stereotype's body. This is done by asking a few questions on those concepts where it is uncertain whether or not they are known to the user, and propagating this new evidence to revise the whole situation.

It defines well-formedness constraints for information-seeking dialogues and contends that strategies for interpreting ill-formed input can be applied to the problem of modeling the user's plan during an ill-formed dialogue. It presents a meta-rule approach for hypothesizing the cause of dialogue ill-formedness, and describes meta-rules for relaxing the plan inference process and enabling the consideration of alternative hypotheses. The advantages of this approach are that it provides a unified framework for handling both well-formed and ill-formed dialogue, avoids unnatural interpretations when the dialogue is proceeding smoothly, and facilitates a nonmonotonic plan recognition system."], "url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01101858"},

By focusing on how instructions activate the knowledge rele/ant to the performance of the specified task, we have successfully modeled major aspects of correct user performance by incorporating in the model knowledge about individual commands and knowledge that allows the correct combination of elementary commands into complex, novel commands. Thus, experts can be modeled in both NETWORK and in UNICOM. We further show that salient aspects of novice and intermediate performance can be described by removing critical elements of knowledge from the expert UNICOM model.

Much research in the field has focused on the development of plan recognition algorithms to support particular user/system interactions, such as found in naturally occurring dialogues. However, two questions have typically remained unexamined: 1) exactly what kind of interface tasks can knowledge of a user's plans be used to support across communication modalities, and 2) how can such tasks in turn constrain development of plan recognition algorithms? In this paper we present a concrete exploration of these issues. In particular, we provide an assessment of plan recognition, with respect to the use of plan recognition in enhancing user interfaces. We clarify how use of a user model containing plans makes interfaces more intelligent and interactive (by providing an intelligent assistant that supports such tasks as advice generation, task completion, context-sensitive responses, error detection and recovery). We then show how interface tasks in turn provide constraints that must be satisfied in order for any plan recognizer to construct and represent a plan in ways that efficiently support these tasks. Finally, we survey how interfaces are fundamentally limited by current plan recognition approaches, and use these limitations to identify and motivate current research. Our research is developed in the context of CHECS, a plan-based design interface."], "url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01101860"},

This paper presents a student model maintenance system (SMMS) which deals with revision of two important types of knowledge in student models: deductive knowledge and stereotypical knowledge. In the SMMS, deductive knowledge is represented by justified beliefs. Its revision is accomplished by a combination of techniques involving reason maintenance and formal diagnosis. Stereotypical knowledge is represented in the Default Package Network (DPN). The DPN is a knowledge partitioning hierarchy in which each node contains concepts in a sub-domain. Revision of stereotypical knowledge is realized by propagating new information through the DPN to change default packages (stereotypes) of the nodes in the DPN. A revision of deductive knowledge may trigger a revision of stereotypical knowledge, which results in a desirable student model in which the two types of knowledge exist harmoniously."], "url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00158953"},

While in limited domains it is possible to have such nested belief models pregenerated, in general it is more reasonable to have a mechanism for generating the nested models on demand. Two methods for such generation are discussed, one based on triggering stereotypes, and the other based on perturbation of the system's beliefs. Both of these approaches have limitations.
